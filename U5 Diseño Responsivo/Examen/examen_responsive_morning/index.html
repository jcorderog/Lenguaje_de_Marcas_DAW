                    <p>On GitHub, lightweight code review tools are built into every pull request. Your team can create
                        review
                        processes that improve the quality of your code and fit neatly into your workflow.</p>

                    <p>
                        On GitHub, project managers and developers coordinate, track, and update their work in one
                        place, so projects
                        stay transparent and on schedule. </p>

                    <p>Between applications and custom tools, there’s no limit to the ways you can build on GitHub. Fine
                        tune your
                        process as your team changes, update tools as technologies shift, and find new ways to work
                        better.</p>
